1. Did that particular submission cover all needed commands? 
 Ibrahim Dauda just sent me screenshot of written commands since he hasn't used those commands, then I shared mine understanding with him about Git commands and we work together now it seems that we have used most of the cammands in the right syntax.


2. If not, what commands were missing? 
However, we could not able to use

-fetch, -Fork, -tag ,-Setting and -stash examples and we couldn't manage to understand these.

3. Do the sequences in which the commands have been written make sense? (try it out in your GIT console)
 
Now, we have same sequence of the cammand which make sense according to my undersanding.
e.g.

git add -- > git commit -- > git push --
4. What are the differences between your submission and that particular submission you are reviewing?
I try to use all given commands in assignment while Ibrahim Daudu, just wrote down the command and sent me but in this morning I try to share my understanding with him and now we almost have same submission.
 
5. If you have found some other useful commands that were missing in the tutorial file, what were these? 

Yes, during the assignment, I was reading some of the google pages for some help and I find out about :

git revert {commit_id}    , use to revert any commit done
git -- help , a very good command to check about most of git functions
git prune, it cleans unreachable or orphaned git commands.this is the grabage collection command.


IN ADDITION:
6. Try out the Javascript based web tool  https://learngitbranching.js.org/ to learn more about branching branching and write down your experience of using it - - does it help you to understand? 

1. It was nice experience to try this link and it really fun to compelte level with git commands and finishes with the help dialog.
2. I learn more about committing, branching and aslo about rebasing with visualization.
3. Moving around in Git i learn anout that HEAD was hiding underneath our master branch all along and Detaching HEAD just means attaching it to a commit instead of a branch.
4.Relative Refs, It might be tedious to type ^ several times, so Git also has the tilde (~) operator. The tilde operator (optionally) takes in a trailing number that specifies the number of parents you would like to ascend. 

Overall, it's good link to learn and still I am trying to learn more from this link becuase it have too many exercises which will take time to do. so hopefully soon I will accomplish all these exercises
